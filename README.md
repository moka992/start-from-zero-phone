# 从零开始做手机

一个面向数码爱好者的网页模拟游戏：从“定义一台手机”开始，走完整个产品周期，观察它在真实感市场逻辑中的表现。

## 项目起点

这个项目的灵感来自日常聊天场景。  
在数码讨论群里，大家经常会围绕“如果由自己来做一台手机，会怎么选配置、怎么定价、怎么做取舍”展开非常热烈的讨论。基于这种广泛存在的创作冲动，我把这个想法做成了一个可交互的模拟器，希望把“口头设想”变成“可验证的产品结果”。

## 这不是只看参数的配置器

游戏不仅覆盖手机设计阶段，也覆盖上市后的经营阶段，包括但不限于：

- 配置与结构设计（SoC、屏幕、影像、材料、额外特性、SKU 组合等）
- 首发策略与产量决策
- 月度运营推进（补货、库存、现金流、口碑、渠道反馈）
- 产品生命周期与企业连续经营

玩家可以从结果反推决策质量：  
这台手机到底是“叫好叫座”，还是“参数很强但市场不买账”。

## 模型与玩法定位

项目中的需求、跑分、口碑、周期波动等都由一套相对复杂的规则驱动，而不是纯随机。  
这些规则结合了我对行业与产品的理解，尽量做到“可玩性”和“合理性”的平衡。

它本质上仍然是娱乐向模拟（图一乐），但不是完全失真的随机游戏。

# Start from Zero: Build a Phone

A web-based simulation game for tech enthusiasts: start by defining your own smartphone, then run it through a full product cycle and see how it performs in a market with realistic constraints.

## Why this project exists

This project came from everyday tech-group conversations.  
People often discuss, in great detail, what kind of phone they would build if they had full control: specs, pricing, trade-offs, and product philosophy. Those discussions were always energetic, but mostly stayed theoretical.  
I built this simulator to turn that creative impulse into something testable and interactive.

## More than a spec picker

The game is not just about hardware configuration.  
It also includes the business side of launching and operating a product, such as:

- Product design choices (SoC, display, camera system, materials, extra features, SKU mix)
- Initial production and launch strategy
- Monthly operations (restocking, inventory, cash flow, reputation, channel feedback)
- Product lifecycle outcomes and multi-generation company management

The core idea is to let players validate decisions through outcomes:  
Does your phone actually fit market demand, or is it only good on paper?

## Modeling approach

Demand, benchmark score, reputation, lifecycle dynamics, and market fluctuations are all driven by layered rules rather than pure randomness.  
These mechanics reflect my own domain understanding and aim to balance gameplay with plausibility.

This is still an entertainment-oriented simulator, but not a completely arbitrary numbers game.

## Development note

This project was built with **Codex collaboration**.  
Thanks to **vibe coding**, I was able to turn a personal idea into a playable product quickly and with low implementation friction.
